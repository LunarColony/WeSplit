# WeSplit
A simple check splitting app, this application is my first proper application in which I incorporated different aspects of the Swift programming language and the SwiftUI framework.
The project was followed alongside the tutorial available on [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/16) project one.
